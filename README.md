# Frontend Threads 2025

A Docusaurus v3 (classic + TypeScript) site for collecting frontend learning threads. Live React playgrounds are available in MDX docs via `@docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock`, with React hooks exposed in the default scope.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The dev server runs at http://localhost:3000/frontend-threads-2025/ with hot reloads.

## Useful scripts

- `npm run build` – create a production build in `build/`
- `npm run serve` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run typecheck` – run the TypeScript compiler
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` – ESLint with import sorting
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` – Prettier for JS/TS/MD/MDX

Docs live in `docs/`, and static assets (images/GIFs/videos) belong in `static/` and can be referenced with absolute paths such as `/img/logo.svg`.
